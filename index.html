        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophomore at Bob Jones University studying Cinema Production. I work for the Cinema department as a building monitor.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy working on media teams and on sets, and I am active in my local church: Pinecrest Baptist Church of McDonough, GA.  I work on the media team at church by running cameras, sound, broadcast graphics. My family is currently rehabbing a baby squirrel that I named Buddy (hence the domain name). He is the cutest squirrel there is.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy photography, spending time with friends, and watching movies.
